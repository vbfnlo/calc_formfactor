This program belongs to the program package VBFNLO and can calculate
input parameters needed for anomalous gauge boson coupling studies
with VBFNLO. 
As especially the pure operators for anomalous quartic gauge boson 
couplings lead to a violation of tree-level unitarity within the energy 
range of the LHC, special care has to be taken to avoid this unphysical
behaviour. Within VBFNLO we have opted for the use of a dipole form 
factor and this tool can calculate the maximal form factor scale 
Lambda_FF which is allowed for a given input of coupling parameters, 
assuming the form factor shape 

            FF = 1 / ( 1 + s / Lambda_FF^2 )^FFexp .

The form factor is determined by calculating on-shell VV scattering and 
computing the zeroth partial wave of the amplitude. As unitarity criterion 
the absolute value of the real part of the zeroth partial wave has to be 
below 0.5 [Barger, Cheung, Han, Phillips; Phys.Rev. D42 (1990) 3052].
Each channel in VV -> VV scattering (with V = W / Z) is checked 
individually, additionally channels with the same electrical charge Q of 
the VV system are combined [Gounaris, Layssac, Renard; Phys.Lett. B332 
(1994) 146 (their definition of thepartial wave expansion differs from ours 
by a factor of 2)].

************
*  Usage:  *
************

* run make in the source directory
* the binary and input file are located in subfolder "run"
* modify run/input.dat
* run ./get-formfactor from the folder "run"

The following compilers have been tested and compile this tool properly:
gfortran (default), g77, ifort.
If you want to switch the compiler, uncomment the appropriate lines in the 
makefile.

By running "./batchrun" all operators can be checked sequentially with a 
given coupling strength. Issuing the command without arguments displays 
a short manual.



************
*  Input:  *
************

In the file "run/input.dat" the following parameters can be set:
* Maximum center-of-mass energy that should be considered
* Desired exponent of the form factor.
  You need at least
  - FFexp = 1 for the dimension-6 operators and
  - FFexp = 2 for the dimension-8 operators.
* Coupling constants of the anomalous couplings



*************
*  Output:  *
*************

The program calculates the energy at which tree-level unitarity would
be violated without a form factor and the form factor scale that
ensures tree-level unitarity up to the given energy.
The form factor scales are also written out to the file "run/ff_output.dat".

The form factor scales are determined in three ways:
* Considering only the helicity combination with the largest contribution
  to the zeroth partial wave, separately for each VV -> VV channel.
* Considering all helicity combinations with contributions to the zeroth
  partial wave by diagonalizing the T-matrix, separately for each VV -> VV channel.
* Considering all helicity combinations with contributions to the zeroth
  partial wave by diagonalizing the T-matrix for all VV -> VV channels 
  with V being a W or Z boson.
